# PDF Question Answering Application

This project is a full-stack application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions related to the content of the PDFs. The backend uses FastAPI and Hugging Face Transformers to handle the PDF processing and question-answering tasks, while the frontend is built with React.

# Prerequisites
